# P3 Neutraliser

This plugin prevents Pipdig's P3 plugin from updating or calling home to malicious Pipdig URLs that could harm your site.

This could be useful if you want to find a new theme, but don't have the time or money or skills to do it right now.

With this plugin active, P3 should not be able to call out to malicious URLs or update itself.

Note that this plugin doesn't prevent injection of Pipdig JavaScript into your site, as doing so would likely result in many functions of your site breaking.

## Installation

1. [Download the latest release][release] as a zip file.
2. Navigate to `Plugins > Add New` on your Site.
3. Click "Upload Plugin" up at the top.
4. Upload the zip file you downloaded.
5. Activate the P3 Neutraliser plugin.
